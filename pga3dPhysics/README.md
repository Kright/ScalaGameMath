## Module with physics engine

Reference implementation, I prefer simple and correct code. But I profiled the code and eliminated some bottlenecks, it
is quite efficient now.

Classes Pga3dMatrixForPoints and Pga3dBivectorMutable are made for performance reasons.

## Example of usage:

```scala
val dynamicBodies: ArrayBuffer[PhysicsBody] =
  ArrayBuffer(
    PhysicsBody.motionless(Pga3dInertia.sphere(mass = 2.0, r = 1), Pga3dMotor.id),
    PhysicsBody.motionless(Pga3dInertia.cube(mass = 2.0, rx = 1, ry = 2, rz = 0.5), Pga3dMotor.id),
...
)

def addGravity(): Unit = {
  val g: Pga3dVector = Pga3dVector(0, -9.8, 0) // y axis down

  for (body <- dynamicBodies) {
    val forque = Pga3dForque.force(body.globalCenterOfMass, g * body.inertia.mass)
    // same as body.globalCenterOfMass v (g * body.inertia.mass)

    body.addGlobalForque(forque)
  }
}

val timeStep = 0.001

for (step <- 0 until stepsCount) {
  time += timeStep

  PhysicsSolverRK4.step(dynamicBodies, timeStep, addForquesToBodies = { (dtInsideStep) =>
    addGravity()
    addSomeOtherForques()
  })
}  
```

Actually, for Runge-Kutta method of fourth grade, function addForquesToBodies is called four times.

## Inertia representations:

* Pga3dInertia: common interface
* Pga3dInertiaSimple: inertia for a case when the body is a fully symmetrical sphere or cube. It has no precession and
  very efficient computation of accelerations and moments of inertia.
* Pga3dInertialLocal: inertia for a common case with three different main exes of inertia
* Pga3dInertiaMovedSimple: case when a body center of mass is not in the center of current coordinates system
* Pga3dInertialMovedLocal: the same for Pga3dInertialLocal. This representation can describe the inertia of any solid
  body.
* Pga3dInertiaPrecomputed: class caching two 6x6 matrices (application and inverse of application) and some properties.
  Suits for speed up computation when one intertia is used in computations a lot of times.
* Pga3dInertiaSummable: summable representation of inertia. Helpful when you want to find inertia of a combined
  connected bodies.
